The Castle of Otranto is a novel by Horace Walpole. First published in 1764, it
is generally regarded as the first gothic novel. In the second edition, Walpole 
applied the word 'Gothic' to the novel in the subtitle – A Gothic Story. Set in
a haunted castle , the novel merged medievalism  and terror in a style that has 
endured  ever since . The aesthetic  of the book has shaped  modern-day  gothic 
books, films, art, music and the goth subculture. Walpole was inspired to write
the  story  after a  nightmare he  experienced at  his  Gothic  Revival  home ,
Strawberry Hill House in southwest London. The novel initiated a literary genre
which would become extremely popular in the later 18th and early 19th century , 
with authors such as  Clara  Reeve , Ann  Radcliffe , William Thomas Beckford ,
Matthew Lewis, Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, Edgar Allan Poe, Robert Louis Steven-
-son and George du Maurier.

Published anonymously in three volumes when the author was only seventeen
years old, The Mummy! is , as she describes it herself , a strange , wild
novel that—to  an audience nearer  her future than when  Loudon  imagined  
it—is filled with  striking similarities to our modern world ,  including 
a form of the internet. But it is also filled with  brilliant  flights of 
fancy: her court ladies wear hair ornaments of controlled flame; surgeons
and lawyers may be  steam-powered automatons ; people holiday  by  moving
their entire home on rails. The visionary technological setting contrasts 
with a morality seemingly gone awry as it falls to the  reanimated  mummy 
Cheops to try to find a role in this  corrupted society . A lost curio of
Victorian futurism waiting to be discovered, The Mummy! is as bizarre and
entertaining as it’s premise promises—and more.

Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in  Saint  Petersburg  who formulates a
plan to  kill an unscrupulous  pawnbroker  for her money . Before the killing ,
Raskolnikov believes that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty
and go  on to perform great deeds . However , once it is done he finds  himself
racked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust for his actions. His justificatio-
-ns disintegrate completely as he struggles with guilt and horror and confronts
