Generally considered the first English sensation novel, The Woman in White 
features the remarkable heroine Marian Halcombe and  her sleuthing partner,
drawing master Walter Hartright,pitted against the diabolical team of Count
Fosco and Sir Percival Glyde. A gripping tale of murder, intrigue, madness,
and mistaken identity, Collins’s psychological  thriller has never been out 
of print in the 140 years since  its publication.  Anne Perry writes in her 
Introduction to this Modern Library Paperback Classic.

The story is presented as a kind of anthropological study of this society through references 
to the families and their activities as tribal. Winner of the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for ficti-
-on, the novel was written in the fragmented  aftermath of the First World War , which Edith
Wharton experienced first-hand in Paris.Newland Archer, the ambivalent protagonist, represe-
-nts the apogee of good  breeding . He is the  ultimate insider  in post-Civil  War New York 
society. Although engaged to May Welland, a beautiful and proper fellow member of elite soc-
-iety , he is attracted to the free-spirited  Countess  Ellen Olenska , May’s  cousin  and a
former  member of their  circle who has been living in  Europe but has left  her husband , a 
cruel Polish nobleman, under mysterious circumstances and returned  to her family’s New York
milieu . His upcoming marriage  to the young  socialite  will unite two of New York’s oldest 
families, but from the novel’s opening pages, Olenska imports a passionate intensity and my-
-sterious Old World eccentricity that disrupt the conventional world of  order-obsessed  New 
York. Ellen’s hopes of being set free from her past are dashed when she is forced to  choose 
between conformity and exile, while Newland’s appointment  by the Welland  family as Ellen’s 
legal consultant begins an emotional entanglement  the force  of which he could  never  have 
imagined.
